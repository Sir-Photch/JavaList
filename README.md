Java alternative to (ugly) ls-command on MacOS

This was intentionally meant to help me with my Java skills, but I liked the idea of customizing my own kind of "Finder"
Its purpose is to make a less oldschool version of ls, with sorting by filetype and colors!

If you want to make this program executable from everywhere,
one way is to create a bash-script and place it in your /usr/local/bin folder (MacOS), I'll provide one here on Github.

This is currently implemented for MacOS, I might try Linux in the future.

I WILL NOT
provide a compiled version of this (for your own safety!)
Download the /src/-path and audit/compile it yourself. 
If you don't know what that means, google "javac"
